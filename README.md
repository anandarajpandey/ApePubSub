What is it?
=====================

ApePubSub is an alternative event driven Pub/Sub framework to the official [APE_JSF](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_JSF) for the [APE Server](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_Server). It is written in plain javascript and is great for beginners, good for those small/simpler projects.

The client framework is based on @paraboul's next generation [APE_JSF](https://github.com/paraboul/APE-Client-JavaScript/tree/31dd239394af8a574667c8228ed8c004d6866973) draft and the server framework is a compilation of custom commads, hooks and rewrites from the official [framework](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_Server/scripts/), the actual server binary do not requires modification.



TODOs
=====================
* Keep working on the files in [php/](https://github.com/ptejada/ApePubSub/tree/master/php/) to create a PHP link between the APE server and the client framework for tighter PHP applications intregrration ( Been consider for separate project)
* Keep testing...
