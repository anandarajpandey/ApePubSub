What is it?
=====================

ApePubSub is an alternative event driven pub/sub framework to the official [APE_JSF](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_JSF) for the [APE Server](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_Server). It is written in plain javascript and is great for beginners, good for those small/simpler projects.

The client framework is based on @paraboul's next generation [APE_JSF](https://github.com/paraboul/APE-Client-JavaScript/tree/31dd239394af8a574667c8228ed8c004d6866973) draft and the server framework is a compilation of custom commads, hooks and rewrites from the official [framework](https://github.com/APE-Project/APE_Server/scripts/), the actual server binary do not requires modification.
